        <h2></h2>
        <p>There was once a kingdom where there lived a princess. She would rule over her loyal subjects
            with a kind heart. She had her loyal protector that would keep her safe from any evil doers.
            His name was <span id = "Mario">_________</span></p>.
        <p>Then it came to pass that a beast came and stole away the princess. This meant only one could save her. 
        He sprang into action. He went on an epic quest going through different worlds to get closer to
        the princess.After a long journey, he then came face to face with the beast name <span id = "Bowser">_________</span>.</p>
        <p>After a long battle between him and this beast, the beast was out smarted and the floor gave way dropping
            the beast into a pool of lava. Then, finding that he had one he rescued Princess <span id = "Peach">_________</span>.
            They then went back to the castle to then repeat this cycle, until someone got bored of playing Super Mario Bros.
