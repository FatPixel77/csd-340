        <h2>Ronnie?</h2>
        <p class="intro">Ronnie is a person who was born in kentucky and has lived here all my life.
            I was raised in a small town but was more like a backwoods neighborhood. It was
            very quiet and peaceful compared to where I live now.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a home where work was the best thing you could do. My dad always 
            worked hard and wanted his kids to do the same. We always worked even after school
            on our little farm. He did reward us though with money for our hard work. 
            We weren't poor but we weren't rich either. </p>
        <p>Since my dad worked his whole life in the mines, he had a great work ethic
            but his body was broken. His back is degraded as well as his knees. He tells me 
            that his whole body hurts all the time. This is why he wanted me to be a nurse. 
            He thought it would be less wear on your body.</p>
        <p>He has been an inspiration to me even though I failed out of nursing school. 
            It just was not for me because I was doing it cause he wanted me to. I still don't
            regret it since that is how I met my wife and she gave me my first son. I wouldn't be
            where I am today if it wasn't for my dad. <span class="sentence">He was the best.</span></p>
